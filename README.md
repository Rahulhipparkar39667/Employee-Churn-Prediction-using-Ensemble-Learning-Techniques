In this project, I implemented an Employee Churn Prediction model using ensemble learning techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), and XGBoost. To optimize the model's performance, I employed Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning. I compared these models using the AUC-ROC curve and determined that Random Forest outperformed the others, although all algorithms achieved an accuracy close to 80%.

To address data imbalance, I applied the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) preprocessing method. Additionally, I performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights from the data. Through feature engineering, I derived new features that helped improve the model's predictive power and aided in decision-making. This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning techniques to solve real-world challenges in workforce management.
